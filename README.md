# Responsive-Portfolio-Website-Tag-along
A tag along project of responsive web programming with Avinash. It also features the use of a functional database (Google seed precisely).

This is a tag-along project; the second actual project to be completed. 
In this project, the responsiveness is mostly a function of the structure. The use of flexbox and grid was heavily employed in the creation of this site. This is perhaps due to the flexibility of those frameworks.

The "flex-basis" property of the flexbox is good for assigning definite ratios to elements within the flexbox. This property also is measured in percentages. Hence, for effective usage of this property, it is advisable to keep the sum total of the percentages below 100. Also, the "justify-content" property is often used to define the horizontal spacing between items in the flexbox, and sometimes the positioning. This property has the possible values: "flex-start", "space-evenly", "space-between", "flex-end".
